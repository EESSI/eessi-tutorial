This is an introductory tutorial to [EESSI](https://www.eessi.io/docs/), the European Environment
for Scientific Software Installations,
with a focus on employing it in the context of High-Performance Computing (HPC).

In this tutorial you will learn what EESSI is, how to get access to EESSI,
how to customise EESSI, and how to use EESSI [repositories](appendix/terminology.md#repository)
on HPC infrastructure.
